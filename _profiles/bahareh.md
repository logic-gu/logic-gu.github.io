My expertise is in proof theory and its application to computational logic. I am particularly interested in expressibility, complexity, and deductive strength in fixed point logics. Other topics that I have worked on and/or are currently pursuing include relative computability, reverse mathematics, ordinal analysis, computational content of proofs, automata theory and games.
