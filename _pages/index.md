Welcome to the webpage of the Logic group at the University of Gothenburg.

More detailed information about our research and activities can be found on the personal pages of [group members]({% link _pages/profiles.md %}) and our [homepage at the University of Gothenburg]({{ site.data.links['flov-logic-group'].url }}).

Our group holds a bi-weekly [research seminar in Logic]({% link seminars/seminars.md %}), the annual [Lindstr√∂m Lecture series]({% link lindstrom-lectures/index.md %}) and other [events]({% link _pages/activities.md %}) including workshops and an annual Gothenburg World Logic Day Pub Quiz.
