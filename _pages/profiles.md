The logic group is part of the [Department of Philosophy, Linguistics and Theory of Science](https://www.gu.se/flov) at the [University of Gothenburg](https://www.gu.se).

Our group has a broad expertise in mathematical, philosophical and computational logic. With a diverse team from varied backgrounds, we integrate different traditions in mathematical logic, ranging from proof theory, models of arithmetics, and dependence logics to modal logic and categorical semantics. Our group is also interested in philosophy of language and applications of logic to linguistics.

We are one of the member groups of the [Scandinavian Logic Society](https://scandinavianlogic.org) which organises a number of events promoting logic in the Nordic regions, for instance the [Nordic Online Logic Seminar](https://scandinavianlogic.org).
