Previous works by Gor√©, Postniece and Tiu have provided sound and cut-free complete proof systems for modal logics extended with path axioms using the formalism of nested sequent. 
Our aim is to provide (i) a constructive cut-elimination procedure and (ii) alternative modular formulations for these systems. We present our methodology to achieve these two goals on a subclass of path axioms, namely quasi-transitivity axioms.
