This dissertation concerns the properties of and relationship between positive truth and fixpoints over intuitionistic arithmetic in three respects: 
the strength of these theories relative to the arithmetic base theories, relationships
between theories of strictly positive fixpoints and compositional and disquotational truth for strictly truth-positive sentences, and a comparison with the
classical case.
