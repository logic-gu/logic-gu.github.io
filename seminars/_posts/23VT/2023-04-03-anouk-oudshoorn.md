The World Wide Web Consortium (<sc>w3c</sc>) set Web Ontology Language (<sc>owl</sc>) and Shape Constraint Language (<sc>shacl</sc>) as international standards for managing semantically enriched data on the web.
However, there is a difference in how these languages handle the completeness of data.
In <sc>owl</sc>, not all information has to be explicitly present; part of the information can be implied by logical rules.
Whereas <sc>shacl</sc>, which enables us to check for certain structures in a given knowledge graph, assumes completeness of it.
Thus, with <sc>shacl</sc> we can validate the given data, while with <sc>owl</sc> we can infer knowledge.
Combining the functionalities of the two into one standard is relevant and not straightforward.

In this seminar talk, we will introduce a new semantics for validating stratified <sc>shacl</sc> constraints, a specific family of queries, in presence of an ontology.
We developed a refined chase technique, producing for each ontology a minimal model, i.e., a labeled graph, in which we can evaluate <sc>shacl</sc> constraints.
However, this technique might still produce infinite models.
This can be avoided by rewriting the <sc>shacl</sc> constraints with respect to the ontology, resulting in a standalone set of <sc>shacl</sc> constraints that can directly be verified only over the data; our second contribution.
