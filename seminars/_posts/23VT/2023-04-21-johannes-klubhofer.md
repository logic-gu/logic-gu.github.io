Automata theory has various applications in the theory of the modal µ-calculus.
One such application is for the tableaux games for the modal µ-calculus introduced by Niwinski and Walukiewicz,
in which one player has a winning strategy iff the formula is satisfiable.
The winning condition of that game can be naturally checked by a nondeterministic parity automaton.
We show how the determinisation of that automaton may be used to obtain a proof system.
We then introduce a determinisation method for nondeterministic parity automata,
which will be used to define a new annotated cyclic proof system for the modal µ-calculus.
