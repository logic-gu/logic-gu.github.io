Substructural logics are logics with restricted use of
structural rules like weakening, contraction and exchange.
There are several motivations for investigating substructural logics
from the study of algebraic structures like residuated (semi)lattices
to the study of type systems which allow for greater control
over the number of times and the order in which variables are used. <!--more--> 

Enriched with fixed point operators, these logics are highly
expressive. In this talk, I will give a brief overview of
substructural logics with fixed points and concentrate specifically
on linear logic with fixed points discussing various proof systems,
their expressivity, and semantics.
