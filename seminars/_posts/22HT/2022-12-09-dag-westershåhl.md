I will first give a brief background, with some examples, on ‘Carnap’s
problem’: to what extent a consequence relation in a formal language fixes the
meaning, relative to some given semantics, of the logical constants in that
language. I then focus on intuitionistic propositional logic and show that it
is ‘Carnap categorical’: the only interpretation of the connectives consistent
with the usual intuitionistic consequence relation is the standard one. This
holds relative to most well-known semantics with respect to which
intuitionistic logic is sound and complete; among them Kripke semantics, Beth
semantics, Dragalin semantics, and topological semantics. It also holds for
algebraic semantics, although categoricity in that case is different in kind
from categoricity relative to possible worlds style semantics. This is joint
work with Haotian Tong.
