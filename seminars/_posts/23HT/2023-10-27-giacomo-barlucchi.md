We prove that ω<sup>2</sup> strictly bounds the iterations required for modal  definable functions to reach a fixed point across all countable structures.
In doing so, we both extend and correct the previously claimed result on closure ordinals of the alternation-free μ-calculus.
The new approach sees a reincarnation of Kozen's well-annotations, originally devised for showing the finite model property for the modal μ-calculus.
We develop a theory of conservative well-annotations where minimality of the annotation is guaranteed, and isolate relevant parts of the structure that necessitate an unfolding of fixed points.
This adoption of well-annotations enables a direct and clear pumping process that rules out closure ordinals between ω<sup>2</sup> and the limit of countability.
