The Nordic Online Logic Seminar (NOL Seminar) is a monthly seminar series initiated in 2021 presenting expository talks by logicians on topics of interest for the broader logic community. 
Initially the series focused on activities of the Nordic logic groups, but has since expanded to offer a variety of talks from logicians around the world.
The seminar is open to professional or aspiring logicians and logic aficionados worldwide.

The tentative time slot is Monday, 16.00-17.30 (Stockholm/Sweden time).
If you wish to receive the Zoom ID and password for it, as well as regular announcements, please subscribe to the [NOL Seminar mailing list](https://listserv.gu.se/sympa/subscribe/nordiclogic).
