I present a topological epistemic logic, motivated by a famous epistemic puzzle: the Surprise Exam Paradox.
It is a fixed-point modal logic, with modalities for knowledge (modelled as the universal modality), knowability of a proposition (represented by the topological interior operator), and (un)knowability of the actual world.
The last notion has a non-self-referential reading (modelled by Cantor derivative: the set of limit points of a given set) and a self-referential one (modelled by the so-called perfect core of a given set: its largest subset which is a fixed point of relativized derivative).
I completely axiomatize this logic, showing that it is decidable and PSPACE-complete, as well as briefly explain how the  same model-theoretic method can be elaborated to prove the completeness and decidability of the full topological mu-calculus.
Finally, I apply it to the analysis of the Surprise Exam Paradox and other puzzles.
