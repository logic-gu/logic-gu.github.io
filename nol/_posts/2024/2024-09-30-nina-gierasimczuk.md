Natural languages vary in their quantity expressions, but the variation seems to be constrained by general properties, so-called universals.
Explanations thereof have been sought among constraints of human cognition, communication, complexity, and pragmatics.
In this work, we examine whether perceptual constraints and coordination dynamics contribute to  the  development  of  two  universals: monotonicity and convexity.
Using a state-of-the-art multi-agent language coordination model (originally applied to colour terms) we evolve communicatively  usable  quantity  terminologies.
We compare the degrees of convexity and monotonicity of languages evolving in populations of agents with and without approximate number sense (ANS).
The results suggest that ANS supports the development of monotonicity and, to a lesser extent, convexity.
We relate our results to some classical observations about generalised quantifiers in mathematical logic and to the research on conceptual spaces.

This is joint work with Dariusz Kalociński, Franek Rakowski and Jakub Uszyński.
