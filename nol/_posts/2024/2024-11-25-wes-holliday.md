Non-classical logics have been proposed in a number of domains, including constructive mathematics and quantum mechanics. In this talk, I will identify a base logic beneath some of these non-classical logics that I suggest has a certain fundamental status. I will give an introduction to the proof theory and semantics of this “Fundamental Logic.”
