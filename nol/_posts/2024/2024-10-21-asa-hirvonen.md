The axioms of quantum mechanics present the state of a quantum system as a unit vector in complex Hilbert space. However, when Dirac [1] presented his bra- and ket-vectors, he had a more general space in mind. Schwartz [4] later gave a rigorous account for Dirac's "vectors" as distributions, but in elementary physics books one still encounters presentations where ket-vectors are presented just as elements of a Hilbert space, and treated with methods from finite-dimensional linear algebra.

During the last years Tapani Hyttinen and I [2,3] have been looking at various models justifying the finite dimensional approaches from such textbooks. Our approaches are based on various embeddings of a Hilbert space into metric ultraproducts of finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. In this talk I will present the basic ideas, their benefits and limitations. Time permitting, I will also contrast our approach to Boris Zilber's work on the same questions, that was the original inspiration for us.
