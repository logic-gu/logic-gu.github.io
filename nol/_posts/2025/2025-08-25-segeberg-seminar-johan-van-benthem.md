Krister Segerberg was one of the architects of modal logic
as we know it today. 
I will highlight a few of his major
contributions and show some of their subsequent impact
in various academic communities. 
I conclude with some
thoughts on the blend of philosophical logic and formal
philosophy embodied in Kristerâ€™s distinguished career.
