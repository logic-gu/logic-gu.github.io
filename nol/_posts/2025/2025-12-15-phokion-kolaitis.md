Databases are typically assumed to have definite content so that users can pose queries and retrieve unambiguous answers.
It is often the case, however, that a database may contain information that is incomplete, inconsistent, or uncertain.
Possible world semantics provides meaning to logic-based queries on databases suffering from these deficiencies.
Such databases are viewed as compact representations of all their possible rectifications; by definition, the certain answers are the query answers that hold true in every possible rectification of a deficient database.

The goal of this lecture is to provide an overview of some of the work on certain answers as a unifying framework for coping with incompleteness, inconsistency, and uncertainty in databases.
Case studies include inconsistent databases, probabilistic databases, and election databases in social choice theory.
