In this talk I will briefly outline Krister’s biography, focusing mainly on the early nineties onwards when I became Krister’s first PhD student. 
By appeal (mostly) to anecdote I will try to highlight what I take to be some of the most notable features in Krister’s approach to and views on pilosophically inspired logical research and education.
