The idea of articulating a propositional logic that adds a relevance-sensitive implication connective
to the usual truth-functional ones has been approached in many ways, e.g. using axioms and
derivation rules, natural deduction systems, possible worlds or states equipped with relations or
operations, algebraic structures, consecution systems etc. None are very satisfactory. In the 1970s,
semantic decomposition trees (aka truth-trees, semantic tableaux, analytic tableaux) were briefly
considered, but they did not get far and were swept away by the tsunami of Routley/Meyer
possible worlds with ternary relations. We renew that approach using a notion of parity for the
branches of a tree or, alternatively, an even more global one of sibling-parity for the entire tree.
There are some nice results and, above all, some big open questions.
