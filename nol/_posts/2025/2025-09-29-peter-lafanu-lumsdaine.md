There is a long tradition of distinguishing *finistic* methods of reasoning, for both philosophical and mathematical motivations.
Typically, this is made precise by reducing arguments to some theory of arithmetic -- usually Peano or Heyting Arithmetic, or weaker fragments thereof.
However, working directly in such systems requires encoding all objects as numbers; it is easy to get the impression that such coding is an inherent and inevitable aspect of the topic.

On the contrary, most major foundational logics -- in particular, ZF-style set theory and dependent type theories -- admit finitistic variants, equivalent in strength to suitable systems of arithmetic.
These allow us to work rigorously in a finististic foundation, while keeping the richly expressive language weâ€™re used to from everyday mathematics.

I will survey various finitistic systems, and then focus in more detail on the categorical Arithmetic Universes of Joyal, and type theories for these, following Maietti.
