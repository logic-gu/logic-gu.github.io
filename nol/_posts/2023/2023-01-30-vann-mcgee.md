Compositional semantics that acknowledge vagueness by positing degrees of truth intermediate between truth and falsity can retain classical sentential calculus, provided the degrees form a Boolean algebra.
A valid deduction guarantees that the degree of truth of the conclusion be at least as great as every lower bound on the degrees of the premises.
If we extend the language to allow infinite disjunctions and conjunctions, the Boolean algebra will need to be complete and atomic.
If we extend further by adding quantifiers ranging over a fixed domain, we get the supervaluations proposed by Bas van Fraassen.
