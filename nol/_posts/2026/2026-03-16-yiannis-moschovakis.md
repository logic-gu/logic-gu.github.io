The claim is that *intensions* (or *meanings*) can be modeled usefully by *algorithms* which compute truth values, proofs (in various systems), denotations and implementations of programs (in various programming languages), etc..
I will discuss the nature of these 'algorithms' and present some unpublished results by me and others on this topic.
Most of what I will say is in the book [1] which contains many unpublished results by Lou van den Dries, Vaughn Pratt, Anush Tserunyan and others.
