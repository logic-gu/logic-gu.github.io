Ibn Sina (Avicenna, 11th century Iran) believed that the foundations of  logic lie in metaphysics. He complained bitterly that this has led  people to confuse logic itself with its foundations and dress up  metaphysics as logic. His own description of the foundations of logic is in overtly ontological language. But from a modern perspective it  becomes clear that in fact he is talking about methodological issues,  like how to represent occurrences of a component within a compound, and  whether the primitive notions of a theory should be stipulated from  outside (as in Tarski) or incorporated into the objects (as in web  ontology and object-based programming). This all has strong implications for any project to formalise Ibn Sina’s logic. My own readings of some  key passages are different from the traditional metaphysical ones, and  seem to me more intelligible and highly comparable with some modern  metalogical and metalinguistic views; but then I have a deaf ear for  metaphysics.
