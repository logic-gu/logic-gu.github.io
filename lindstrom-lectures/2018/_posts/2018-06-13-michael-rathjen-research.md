The graph minor theorem, GM, is arguably the most important theorem  of graph theory. The strength of GM exceeds that of the standard  classification systems of RM known as the “big five”. The plan is to  survey the current knowledge about the strength of GM and other  Kruskal-like principles, presenting lower and upper bounds.
