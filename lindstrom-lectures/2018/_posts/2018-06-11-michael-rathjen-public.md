The fact that “natural” theories, i.e. theories which have something  like an ‘idea’ to them, are almost always linearly ordered with regard  to logical strength has been called one of the great mysteries of the  foundation of mathematics. Using paradoxical methods, e.g.  self-reference Rosser-style, one can distill theories with incomparable  logical strengths and show that the degree structure of logical  strengths is dense in that between two theories S < T one can always  find a third Q such that S < Q < T. But are there ‘natural’  examples of such phenomena? We also know how to produce a stronger  theory by adding the consistency of the theory. Can we get a stronger  theory by adding something weaker than consistency that is still  “natural”? These and other questions will be broached in the talk.
