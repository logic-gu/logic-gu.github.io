In his classical 1892 article On sense and denotation, Frege  associates with each declarative sentence its denotation (truth value)  and also its sense (meaning) “wherein the mode of presentation [of the  denotation] is contained”. For example, 1+1=2 and there are infinitely  many prime numbers are both true, but they mean different things - they  are not synonymous. Frege [1892] has an extensive discussion of senses  and their properties, including, for example, the claim that the same  sense has different expressions in different languages or even in the  same language; but he does not say what senses are or give an  axiomatization of their theory which might make it possible to prove  these claims. This has led to a large literature by philosophers of  language and logicians on the subject, which is still today an active  research topic. A plausible approach that has been discussed by many  (including Michael Dummett) is suggested by the “wherein” quote above:  in slogan form, the sense of a sentence is an algorithm which computes  its denotation. Coupled with a rigorous definition of (abstract,  possibly infnitary) algorithms, this leads to a rich theory of meaning  and synonymy for suitably formalized fragments of natural language,  including Richard Montague’s Language of Intensional Logic. My aim in  this talk is to discuss with as few technicalities as possible how this  program can be carried out and what it contributes to our understanding  of some classical puzzles in the philosophy of language.
