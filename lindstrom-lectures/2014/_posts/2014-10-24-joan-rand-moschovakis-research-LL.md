Each variety of reverse mathematics attempts to determine a minimal  axiomatic basis for proving a particular mathematical theorem. Classical reverse analysis asks which set existence axioms are needed to prove  particular theorems of classical second-order number theory.  Intuitionistic reverse analysis asks which intuitionistically accepted  properties of numbers and functions suffice to prove particular theorems of intuitionistic analysis using intuitionistic logic; it may also  consider the relative strength of classical principles which do not  contradict intuitionistic analysis.

S. Simpson showed that many theorems of classical analysis are  equivalent, over a weak system PRA of primitive recursive arithmetic, to one of the following set existence principles: recursive comprehension, arithmetical comprehension, weak Konig’s Lemma, arithmetical  transfinite recursion, Π11 comprehension. Intermediate principles are  studied also. Intuitionistic analysis depends on function existence  principles: countable and dependent choice, fan and bar theorems,  continuous choice.

The fan and bar theorems have important mathematical equivalents. W.  Veldman, building on a proof by T. Coquand, recently showed that over  intuitionistic two-sorted recursive arithmetic BIM the principle of open induction is strictly intermediate between the fan and bar theorems,  and is equivalent to intuitionistic versions of a number of classical  theorems. Intuitionistic logic separates classically equivalent versions of countable choice, and it matters how decidability is interpreted. R. Solovay recently showed that Markov’s Principle is surprisingly strong  in the presence of the bar theorem. The picture gradually becomes clear.
