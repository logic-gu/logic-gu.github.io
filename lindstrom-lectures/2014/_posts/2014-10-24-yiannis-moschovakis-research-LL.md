The language L over a fixed vocabulary K is an (applied) typed  λ-calculus with additional constructs for acyclic recursion and  attitudinal application, an extension of Montague’s Language of  Intensional Logic LIL as formulated by Daniel Gallin. It is  denotationally interpretable in the classical typed λ-calculus over K,  but intensionally richer: in particular, it can define the referential  intension of each term A, an abstract algorithm which computes the  denotation of A and provides a plausible explication of its meaning. 

The key mathematical construction of L is an effective reduction calculus  which compiles each term A into an (essentially) unique canonical form  cf(A), a denotational term which explicates the logical form of A and  from which the referential intension of A can be read off. The central  open problem about L (over a finite, interpreted vocabulary) is the  decidability of global synonymy - and it is a problem about the  classical, interpreted typed λ-calculus.
