**Abstract**
This dissertation concerns the properties of and relationship between positive
truth and fixpoints over intuitionistic arithmetic in three respects: the strength
of these theories relative to the arithmetic base theories, relationships between
theories of positive fixpoints and compositional and disquotational truth
for truth-positive sentences, and a comparison with the classical case.

After introducing the setting and the earlier work in the field in Chapter 1
as well as the tools and their background in Chapter 2, the main work of this
dissertation unfolds. Chapter 3 introduces a hierarchy exhausting the almost
negative formulae and constructs a hierarchy of satisfaction predicates for them.
Chapter 4 applies a realizability interpretation in Beeson‚Äôs logic of partial terms
(Beeson, 1985) and the Diagonal Lemma in the form of Aczel‚Äôs trick (Aczel,
1977) to those satisfaction predicates to yield Arai‚Äôs theorem (Arai, 2011) of
conservativity of theories of finitely iterated strictly positive fixpoints over Heyting arithmetic. The contents of Chapters 3 and 4 cover the same material as was
presented in (Granberg Olsson and Leigh, 2024) (in which much of Chapter
2 appeared as background), though in some more technical detail. Chapter 5
generalises the result of Cantini (1989), Feferman (1991), Halbach (2009) and
Fujimoto (2011), that the theories of (ùõº-iterations of) positive disquotational
(type-free) truth, positive compositional (type-free) truth and positive fixpoints
are mutually interpretable, from the classical to the intuitionistic setting for a
notion of iteration sensitive also to the negative nesting depth of fixpoints. A
summary of the work, including a comparison of the methods used to similar
methods in the literature, concludes the dissertation in Chapter 6.
