On Monday, 25 August the [Nordic Online Logic Seminar]({{ '/nol/' | prepend: site.baseurl }}) will host a special event in memory of Krister Segerberg, who passed away in January this year.
Krister Segerberg was Professor of Theoretical Philosophy at Uppsala and, among logicians, is widely known for his pioneering work in modal logic where he initiated an influential systematic study of completeness proofs that still is standard in the field.

The seminar will feature talks by two academics that knew Krister Segerberg well:

- [Johan van Benthem (UvA), _Building Modern Modal Logic: Honoring Krister Segerberg_]({% link nol/_posts/2025/2025-08-25-segeberg-seminar-johan-van-benthem.md %})
- [John Cantwell (KTH), _Some reflections on Kristerâ€™s philosophy of philosopy_]({% link nol/_posts/2025/2025-08-25-segeberg-seminar-john-cantwell.md %})

A URL for this seminar will be distributed via the [GU Logic]({{ site.data.links.gu-mailing-list.url }}) and [Nordic Online Logic]({{ site.data.links.nol-mailing-list.url }}) mailing lists.
