#### Wednesday, 24 September

- 9.00 _Registration_
- 9.30 **Alexis Saurin** -- _Title TBA_
- 10.30 _Break_
- 11.00 **Alex Leitsch** -- _Proof Schemata and Herbrand systems_
    > _Abstract_ A proof schema is an expression (recursively) representing an infinite sequence of proofs.
    > Proof schemata depend on parameters (variables over natural numbers) and evaluate to proofs when the parameters are replaced by numerals.
    > These schemata provide a formalism to express induction without induction rules.
    > The main application of proof schemata lies in the (automated) analysis of mathematical proofs using induction.
    > While Herbrand's theorem fails in presence of induction it can be realized in proof schemata.
    > Instead of a single Herbrand sequent (we work in sequent calculus) we obtain an infinite sequence of Herbrand sequents.
    > A Herbrand system is the corresponding  (recursively defined) infinite sequence of Herbrand substitutions defining the Herbrand sequents.
    > As, in general, the computation of a Herbrand sequent requires cut-elimination, a cut-elimination method for schemata is needed.
    > Schematic CERES (Cut-elimination by RESolution) is such a method which will be presented in brief.
    > By their potential in extracting relevant information from mathematical proofs, Herbrand systems provide a powerful tool in automated proof analysis.
- 12.00 _Lunch_               
- 13.30 **Marianna Girlando** -- _Propositional Dynamic Logic to Transitive Closure Logic: Cyclic Proofs via Hypersequents_
 > _Abstract_ 
 > Propositional Dynamic Logic (PDL) is a modal logic for reasoning about 
 > the iterative execution of programs.
 > Via the standard translation, PDL can be embedded into Transitive Closure 
 > Logic (TCL), an extension of first-order logic with a recursive operator 
 > expressing the transitive closure of binary relations.
 > Cyclic proof systems based on Gentzen-style sequents have been developed 
 > for both PDL and TCL in the literature, but cyclic proofs for PDL do not 
 > directly translate into cyclic proofs for TCL.
 > Therefore, the standard translation does not lift to the level of 
 > Gentzen-style cyclic proofs.
 > Motivated by this observation, we introduce a hypersequent-style cyclic 
 > proof system for TCL, which enriches Gentzen-style sequents with 
 > additional structural connectives.
 > We prove that this system is sound and that it simulates cyclic proofs for 
 > PDL, thereby establishing cut-free completeness for a fragment of TCL.
 >  
 > This talk is based on joint work with Anupam Das, published in the Journal 
 > of Automated Reasoning: 
 > <https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10817-023-09675-1>.
 > A preprint is available here: <https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.08616>
- 14.30 **Iris van der Giessen** -- _Uniform interpolation for intuitionistic Gödel-Löb logic_
 > _Abstract_
 > In this talk I would like to present ongoing joint work with Guillermo 
 > Menéndez Turata and Borja Sierra Miranda.
 > The research is concerned with proving the uniform interpolation for 
 > Gödel-Löb logics using cyclic proofs.
 > From a cyclic sequent system a so-called pre-interpolant template is 
 > extracted which is a tree with cycles.
 > Based on this template fixpoint equations are obtained and solved in the 
 > Gödel-Löb logic obtaining uniform interpolants.
 > The method works to reprove the uniform interpolation property for 
 > Gödel-Löb logic GL.
 > Most interestingly, it provides a first proof of the uniform interpolation 
 > property for intuitionistic Gödel-Löb logic iGL.
- 15.30 Break 
- 16.00 **Helle Hvid Hansen** -- _Craig Interpolation for PDL via Cyclic Tableaux_
 > _Abstract_ 
 > The question of whether Propositional Dynamic Logic (PDL) has Craig 
 > interpolation was disputed for several years, with three proof attempts 
 > being published but later criticized or retracted.
 > In this talk, I will present a proof based on the ideas of Borzechowski 
 > (1988).
 > The proof uses a cyclic tableau system for PDL and an adaptation of 
 > Maehara's method.
 > In this approach, interpolants for cycles are obtained as the solutions to 
 > fixpoint equations, and the challenge is to ensure that these fixpoint 
 > equations have solutions in PDL.
 > To achieve this, the construction of interpolants for clusters (strongly 
 > connected components) employs an auxiliary structure called a 
 > quasi-tableau.
 > 
 > This is joint work with Malvin Gattinger, Revantha Ramanayake, Valentina 
 > Trucco Dalmas and Yde Venema.

#### Thursday 25 September

- 9.00  **Takeshi Tsukada** -- _Title TBA_
- 10.00 Break 
- 10.30 **Reuben Rowe** -- _Algorithms for Checking Infinite Descent_
  > _Abstract_ 
  > The (PSPACE-complete) Infinite Descent property underpins the 
  > trace-based validation of cyclic derivations that capture inductive and 
  > coinductive reasoning, as well as the size-change approach to proving 
  > program termination.
  > In the literature, we find a couple of different algorithms described for 
  > deciding Infinite Descent: a dynamic programming algorithm incorporating 
  > a fixed-point saturation (e.g. as suggested in the size-change 
  > termination paper by Lee, Jones, and Ben-Amram), and an encoding via 
  > containment of omega automata (e.g. in Brotherston's thesis).
  >
  > In this talk I will describe work in which we have developed an 
  > alternative automata-theoretic encoding (with some connections to a 
  > construction described by Dax, Hoffman and Lange) and an optimisation of 
  > the dynamic programming algorithm that takes into account some specific 
  > symmetries present in the Infinite Descent problem. 
  > I will also describe some more efficient, but approximate (i.e. 
  > incomplete) approaches for checking Infinite Descent that we have 
  > developed. 
  > I will comment on the relative tradeoffs in the (runtime) complexity of 
  > the decision procedures, and report on an experimental evaluation of our 
  > implementations of these algorithms within the Cyclist theorem prover 
  > framework. 
  > Interestingly, we found the approximate methods to provide good coverage 
  > in practice.

- 14.00 **Anupam Das** -- _Title TBA_
- 15.00 Break 
- 15.30 **Sebastian Enqvist** -- _Computation by infinite descent made explicit_
 > _Abstract_
 > I will present a non-wellfounded proof system for intuitionistic logic 
 > extended with ordinary inductive and co-inductive definitions, based on 
 > a syntax in which fixpoint formulas are annotated with explicit variables 
 > for ordinals. My main motivation for studying this system was to get a 
 > better understanding of the recently introduced validity criterion for 
 > non-wellfounded proofs in terms of so called "bouncing threads". I will 
 > describe the computational content of this system via a notion of 
 > computability and show that every valid proof is computable. A consequence 
 > of this result is that every proof of a sequent of the appropriate form 
 > represents a unique function on natural numbers. Finally, we derive a 
 > categorical model from the proof system and show that least and greatest 
 > fixpoint formulas correspond to initial algebras and final coalgebras 
 > respectively.


#### Friday 26 September

- 9.30 **Zeinab Galal** -- _A categorical viewpoint on systems of fixpoint equations_
 > _Abstract_
 > Fixpoints play an important role in both denotational semantics where they
 > are used to represent recursively defined programs and data types as well
 > as in operational semantics where many behavioral equivalences are
 > obtained as fixpoints of some relation transformers.
 > 
 > In the categorical theory of fixpoint operators, we usually consider one
 > fixpoint operator at a time and little attention is given to the study of
 > mixed fixpoint operators where we take a different fixpoint operator for
 > each variable. Systems combining least and greatest fixpoints over
 > lattices are an important example as they are the basis of many static
 > analysis and model checking methods.
 > 
 > I will present in this talk an axiomatization of mixed fixpoint operators
 > first in the 1-categorical setting and then briefly mention how to extend
 > to 2-categories in order to capture the examples of (parametrized) initial
 > algebras and coalgebras of accessible functors, analytic and polynomial
- 10.30 Break
- 11.00 **Hening Basold** -- _Invariants in Cyclic Proofs_
 > _Abstract_
 > In this talk, I will present general category theoretical approaches to
 > recursive computations and proofs, which are ensured to be well-defined by 
 > local invariants. That is, it is not necessary to check programs and 
 > proofs as a whole to guarantee that they have productive operational 
 > semantics, rather the conditions are checked at each step of their 
 > composition. A well-known instance is guarded recursion in the so-called 
 > topos of trees and the resulting type systems with the so-called later 
 > modality. We will discuss how the approach of guarded recursion can be 
 > extended to other categories than that of sets and maps, which is where 
 > the topos of trees originates, and even to situations that are not 
 > Cartesian. This allows us to construct recursive proof systems for 
 > non-classical, modal and quantitative logic. However, from the coalgebraic 
 > perspective, we can only construct causal computations and proofs in the 
 > topos of trees, which means that each approximation step of a recursion 
 > only depends on previous steps. We will see in the talk how to move beyond 
 > this and devise a category theoretical approach to guarded recursion that 
 > captures uniform continuity. This enables a much broader class of 
 > recursive computations and proofs that are guaranteed to be well-defined 
 > by local invariants.
